This project was supposed to become an application for admin panel of mobile news portal.

There is no registration page, cause basic starting options are supposed to be loaded from fixtures.js, where examples of all entities are listed.

Basically, the access to CRUD operation of all entities could be done by admin from dashboard. However, it doesn't mean that all the functions of application are for admin only. Several functions are open to any user without respect to their roles.

The goal of this application is to provide admin staff with opportunity to comfortably work with data. Thus, this application doesn't include client part.
